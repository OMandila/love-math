# Love-Maths
## Introduction
**Love Maths** is your go to App for sharpening your mental aptitude for simple arithmetic calculations. It was inspired by the following mutual factors:
- Code Institute's walkthrough project to teach the basics of JavaScript and the DOM using a maths game as part of the curriculum for the Diploma in Full-Stack Software Development course
- The need to engage my children and their classmates in mental arithmetic activities during their play dates

## Implemented features
1. An addition, a subtraction, a multiplication and a division game that requires integers as answers
2. A counter for tracking correct and incorrect answers
3. An attractive user interface that is responsive on all screen sizes

## Additonal features to be implemented
1. Provide better feedback to the user instead of using alert()
2. Add difficulty levels - Easy, Normal, Difficult - that affect the complexity of the questions
3. Add a countdown timer to the game
4. Add a high-score chart for people who get the most answers right in the time available (research using local storage)
